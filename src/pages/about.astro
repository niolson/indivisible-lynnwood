        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Indivisible Lynnwood is a local grassroots group made up of concerned citizens, neighbors,
          and community members in Lynnwood, Washington and the surrounding area. We come from diverse
          backgrounds but share a common commitment to protecting democratic values and building a more
          just, equitable community.

        <h2>Our Connection to Indivisible National</h2>
        <p>
          We are a local chapter of <a href="https://indivisible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indivisible</a>,
          a nationwide grassroots movement that began in 2017. Inspired by a practical guide for
          civic engagement written by former congressional staffers, the Indivisible movement has
          grown into thousands of local groups across every state, working together to defend
          democracy and hold elected officials accountable.
