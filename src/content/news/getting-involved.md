Looking for ways to make a difference in your community? Here are some of the most impactful things you can do right now.

## Attend a Meeting

Our regular meetings are a great place to start. You'll meet like-minded neighbors, learn about current issues, and find out where your energy can have the most impact.

## Contact Your Representatives

One of the most effective actions you can take is reaching out to your elected officials. Whether it's a phone call, email, or showing up at a town hall, your voice matters.

## Volunteer Your Skills

We need people with all kinds of skills:

- **Organizers** to help plan events and actions
- **Writers** to help with communications and social media
- **Canvassers** to help with outreach in our community
- **Tech helpers** to support our digital presence

## Spread the Word
